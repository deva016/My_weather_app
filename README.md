## Technologies Used

- **React** - Frontend library for building the UI.
- **Next.js** - Full-stack framework for React, for server-side rendering (SSR) and routing.
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive and modern UIs.
- **OpenWeather API** - For fetching weather data.
- **Node.js** - Backend environment to run Next.js app.
- **Vercel** - Deployment platform (optional).

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Fetch current weather data based on city input.
- **City Search**: Search for weather information for any city.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages are displayed for invalid city searches or API issues.
- **Dark Mode**: A modern design that supports both light and dark themes.
- **Detailed Information**: Display temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and weather conditions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (>= v16)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- A code editor like **VSCode**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deva016/My_weather_app.git
   cd My_weather_app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Running Locally

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

2. **Access the app**:
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application running.

### Deployment

1. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Push your changes to GitHub (or any git provider).
   - Sign in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and click "New Project".
   - Link your GitHub repository and deploy the app.
   
   Vercel will automatically build and deploy the app for you.

## API Setup

This application uses the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data. To get started, you need to sign up for an API key.

1. **Create an account** on [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api).
2. **Get an API Key** from the "API keys" section.
3. **Create a `.env.local` file** in the root of your project and add your API key:
   
   ```env
   OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

4. Now you are ready to make requests to the OpenWeather API. The application will fetch data using this key.
